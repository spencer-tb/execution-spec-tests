# Changelog

Test fixtures for use by clients are available for each release on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases).

**Key:** ✨ = New, 🐞 = Fixed, 🔀 = Changed, 💥 = Breaking change.

## 🔜 [Unreleased - v1.0.7](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v1.0.7) - 2023-XX-XX: 🐍

### 🧪 Test Cases

### 🛠️ Framework

- ✨ Add a `--single-fixture-per-file` flag to generate one fixture JSON file per test case ([#331](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/331)).
- 🔀 Rename test fixtures names to match the corresponding pytest node ID as generated using `fill` ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/342)).
- 💥 Replace "=" with "_" in pytest node ids and test fixture names ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/342)).
- ✨ Fork objects used to write tests can now be compared using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` operators, to check for a fork being newer than, newer than or equal, older than, older than or equal, respectively when compared against other fork ([#367](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/367))
- 🐞 Storage type iterator is now fixed ([#369](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/369))

### 🔧 EVM Tools

### 📋 Misc

- 🔀 Docs: Update `t8n` tool branch to fill tests for development features in the [readme](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-test) ([#338](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/338)).

## Breaking Changes

1. In this release the pytest node ID is now used for fixture names (previously only the test parameters were used), this should not be breaking. However, "=" in both node IDs and therefore fixture names, have been replaced with "_", which may break tooling that depends on the "=" character.

   Pytest node ID example:

   - Previous node ID: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork=Frontier]`
   - New node ID: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]`

   Fixture name example:
   - Previous fixture name: `fork=Frontier`
   - New fixture name: `fork_Frontier`

## [v1.0.6](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v1.0.6) - 2023-10-19: 🐍🏖️ Cancun Devnet 10

### 🧪 Test Cases

- 🔀 [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844): Update KZG point evaluation test vectors to use data from the official KZG setup and Mainnet Trusted Setup ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/336)).

### 🛠️ Framework

- 🔀 Fixtures: Add a non-RLP format field (`rlp_decoded`) to invalid blocks ([#322](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/322)).
- 🔀 Spec: Refactor state and blockchain spec ([#307](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/307)).

### 🔧 EVM Tools

- ✨ Run geth's `evm blocktest` command to verify JSON fixtures after test case execution (`--verify-fixtures`) ([#325](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/325)).
- ✨ Enable tracing support for `ethereum-spec-evm` ([#289](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/289)).

### 📋 Misc

- ✨ Process: Added a Github pull request template ([#308](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/308)).
- ✨ Docs: Changelog updated post release ([#321](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/321)).
- ✨ Docs: Add [a section explaining execution-spec-tests release artifacts](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/using_fixtures/) ([#334](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/334)).
- 🔀 T8N Tool: Branch used to generate the tests for Cancun is now [lightclient/go-ethereum@devnet-10](https://github.com/lightclient/go-ethereum/tree/devnet-10) ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/336))

### 💥 Breaking Change

- fixtures: All tests until the last stable fork (Shanghai)
- fixtures_develop: All tests until the last development fork (Cancun)
- fixtures_hive: All tests until the last stable fork (Shanghai) in hive format (Engine API directives instead of the usual BlockchainTest format)
- fixtures_develop_hive: All tests until the last development fork (Cancun) in hive format
